    "In biology, classification is fundamental. Traditionally, scientists (taxonomists) would use observable traitsâ€”like the size and shape of a fish's fins or the length of a cat's tail. Today, we can collect large amounts of data and use computational tools to help us find these patterns, sometimes in ways that aren't obvious to the human eye. This is a core concept in the field of bioinformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have been doing supervised learning, where the dataset is labelled. In other words, we know the right answer to the prediction. However, there are machine learning algorithms that can find patterns in unlabelled data to develop groups that can then be assigned labels. This is called **unsupervised learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great introduction to unsupervised learning is **k-means clustering**. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together. K-means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms due to its simplicity and effectiveness."
